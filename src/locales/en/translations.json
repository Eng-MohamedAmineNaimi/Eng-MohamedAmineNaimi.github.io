  "AboutDescription": "I am a Full-Stack Developer & IT Engineer with strong expertise in modern technologies. I am proficient in various programming languages, libraries, and frameworks such as Java, JEE, Spring Boot, Docker, Angular, and React, allowing me to design and develop enterprise-level web applications from frontend to backend. I leverage tools like Swagger, Postman, and Insomnia for API management and testing, and I rely on Git and GitHub for version control and seamless project collaboration. Additionally, my experience with AWS services (S3, RDS, EC2, IAM) enables me to efficiently manage cloud infrastructures. \n My goal is to collaborate with innovative companies, delivering high-quality, scalable solutions that drive business value and meet clients' specific needs"
