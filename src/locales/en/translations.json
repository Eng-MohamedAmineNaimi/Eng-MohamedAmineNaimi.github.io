  "AboutDescription": "I am an IT engineer with extensive expertise in IT technologies, including languages, libraries, and frameworks such as Java, JEE, Spring Boot, Docker, Angular, and React. I frequently use tools like Swagger, Postman, and Insomnia for managing and testing APIs, and leverage Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration. I have substantial knowledge of AWS services like S3, RDS, EC2, and IAM, which allows me to handle cloud infrastructures and deploy secure applications. My focus is on working collaboratively to deliver custom solutions that are both functional and scalable, ensuring that the final product meets the specific needs of my clients. Let’s join forces and bring your vision to life."
